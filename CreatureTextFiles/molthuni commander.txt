The commanders of the Molthuni military are among the most influential people in that nation. As both Imperial citizens and military officers, they stand at the pinnacle of their rigidly stratified society—the country is run by a military oligarchy, so those seeking political power must go through the military. Molthuni commanders have done just that, and are fiercely loyal to the regime that granted them their high station. 

Highly expansionist, Molthune seeks to be a major player in the Inner Sea region. Though the Molthuni consider none of their neighbors allies, only Nirmathas is viewed as weak enough to be vulnerable to conquest. Molthune has been at war with the smaller nation on and off for decades. Molthuni commanders are highly suspicious of any outsiders and those lacking the proper travel papers. Pathfinders and Nirmathi, especially, are considered enemies of the state; if any are discovered, a Molthuni commander and his forces will do what is necessary to remove the threat to the nation.
